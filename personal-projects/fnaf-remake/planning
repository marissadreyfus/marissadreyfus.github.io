things i'll need:
    seperate start menu
        start game
        set ai
        options maybe?
    custom ai menu
        i don't feel like making the nights, so it'll just be the custom night part
        will not include golden freddy in set ai because they're special
        maybe an "allow golden freddy" option w/ true or false
    power mechanic. 
        it drains faster when cams, doors, and lights are used
        faster draining stacks
    working cams
        multiple parts of cams.
        one cam just has audio
        one cam stops foxy from moving
        drains power
    working doors
        prevents animatronics from entering
        will stay as long as button was pressed an uneven amount of times
        will open again if even presses
        drains power
    working door lights
        lights up door area
        will only be active if button is being pressed
        drains power
    movement chances for animatronics
        individual variables for each, except golden freddy
        random number compared to ai number
        if random is less or equal to ai number, move
    behaviors for:
        bonnie
            can move if random number generated for movement chance is less than or equal to ai level
            has a set path
        chica
            same as bonnie
            different set path
        foxy
            movement is stopped if a specific cam is being looked at. if this happens, random number is set to 0 always
            if movement reaches final location, will sprint down hallway
            if door is closed, drains power. increase power drain for every time this happens
        freddy
            same as bonnie and chica
            different set path
            will have sound cues probably
        golden freddy (maybe)
            randomly generates a number if a specific cam is flipped up or looked at
            if random number is 1, when camera is flipped down, spawn them
            flip camera up, then back down, to despawn
            unless you get super unlucky and spawn them twice
    timer for nights
        unsure how long each hour will be.
        might include a timer with minutes like in ucn
        maybe each hour is a minute long. would have to drain power faster if so
