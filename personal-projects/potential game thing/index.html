<!--day 1 - March 13th, 2024: 
    - added index.html file
    - put a placeholder title w/ html & head
-->
<!--day 2 note: add climbing later on
    - note from May 8th, 2024 - setup is there now! still not coded as of now but pseudocode is all written in handleKeyDown and handleKeyUp
    - note 2 from May 8th, 2024 - no way of testing yet but code is written
-->
<!--day 2 - March 14th, 2024: 
    - added index.js and index.css files
    - added '.player' to css as a placeholder graphic, does not move yet and is invisible
        - (UPDATE: '#player' now, as of May 8th, 2024 at around 10:30 AM i didn't record this immediately, still no movement but can be seen)
        - (UPDATE 2: '#gamma' now, as of May 8th, 2024 at 2:31 PM)
    - added body tag
    -->
<!--day 3 - May 8th, 2024: didn't have much time to work on this whoops
    - fixed css so that now the player is listed with an id instead of a class
    - added the player div because i forgot to do that
    - added a background color (the white bg was blinding me)
    - added keycodes
    - added player obj into index.js (UPDATE: renamed gamma bc i finally named the character)
    - added $(document).ready(runProgram); for consistency's sake
    - added the runProgram function so that the game actually functions
    - borrowed some const variables from walker (fps and board height/width) - board height/width are unused for now but it's there for when i need it
    - borrowed the css link loading thing, & the jquery and index.js script calling lines from walker
    - changed player size from 10px to 50px each side bc i didn't realize how small 10px was and i need to see the player to playtest controls
    - moved player down so i can test the jump & gravity when i add it, currently hardcoded but will make it resizeable when i get to that
    - added the floor to divs & css, currently an id bc it probably won't end up changing or being reused but if needed i'll change to a class, css is a bunch of placeholders
    - adjusted player y to test gravity when i add it & changed player border to white so i can see it
    - added newFrame to js
    - borrowed the one-time setup from walker js so the game functions
    - borrowed the endGame function just in case i decide to use it (probably won't until i add actual hazards)

    **PUSHED!**

    - **FIXED THIS!** after i pushed i realized it's refusing to run bc of some error in html, will ask in 5th hour today what i should do to fix it
        - didn't realize i needed the jquery library, that's added now and it works
    - setup for the handleKeyDown and handleKeyUp functions, still does nothing bc i'm gonna change the player function but the if conditions are there as well as some pseudocode for how it'll function when i actually code it

    **PUSHED!**

    - finally decided on a name for the player: Gamma! like the greek letter, & also "In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 3" i'm gonna use the number 3 a lot in reference to the character now i'm so normal about this
        - oh yeah and i adjusted the css, html div, and player obj to be named gamma instead
    - added isClimbing for the keyup keydown functions to work, automatically set to false but will have a helper function to set it to true whenever i add that
        - i have no way to playtest this yet but it's there for when i need it
    - save for climbing being functional & jumping/crouching, finished handleKeyDown
        - will do the jump tomorrow with help from youtube probably, crouching might have to wait tho
    - similarly to handleKeyDown, finished handleKeyUp for everything that doesn't involve jumping climbing or crouching
    - currently no way to playtest this bc i haven't made the helper functions to reposition and redraw gamma, but it's basically the same as every other time i've done it so it probably works
    - probably gonna start on a rough traditional sketch for the sprite sheet tonight or tomorrow, idk how to implement a sprite sheet but that's what youtube is for!
    
    **PUSHED!**
