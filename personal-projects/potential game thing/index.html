<!--day 1 - March 13th, 2024: added index.html file. put a placeholder title w/ html & head-->
<!--day 2 note: add climbing later on
    - note from May 8th, 2024 - setup is there now! still not coded as of now but pseudocode is all written in handleKeyDown and handleKeyUp
-->
<!--day 2 - March 14th, 2024: added index.js (empty by the end of day 2) and index.css files. added '#player' to css as a placeholder graphic, does not move yet and is invisible. added body tag, currently empty.-->
<!--day 3 - May 8th, 2024: didn't have much time to work on this whoops; debrief!
    - fixed css so that now the player is listed with an id instead of a class
    - added the player div because i forgot to do that
    - added a background color (the white bg was blinding me)
    - added keycodes
    - added player obj into index.js, **will make reusable later on in this debrief, edit this when done with that part**
    - added $(document).ready(runProgram); for consistency's sake
    - added the runProgram function so that the game actually functions
    - borrowed some const variables from walker (fps and board height/width) - board height/width are unused for now but it's there for when i need it
    - borrowed the css link loading thing, & the jquery and index.js script calling lines from walker
    - changed player size from 10px to 50px each side bc i didn't realize how small 10px was and i need to see the player to playtest controls
    - moved player down so i can test the jump & gravity when i add it, currently hardcoded but will make it resizeable when i get to that
    - added the floor to divs & css, currently an id bc it probably won't end up changing or being reused but if needed i'll change to a class, css is a bunch of placeholders
    - adjusted player y to test gravity when i add it & changed player border to white so i can see it
    - added newFrame to js
    - borrowed the one-time setup from walker js so the game functions
    - borrowed the endGame function just in case i decide to use it (probably won't until i add actual hazards)

    **PUSHED!**

    - **FIXED THIS!** after i pushed i realized it's refusing to run bc of some error in html, will ask in 5th hour today what i should do to fix it
        - didn't realize i needed the jquery library, that's added now and it works
    - setup for the handleKeyDown and handleKeyUp functions, still does nothing bc i'm gonna change the player function but the if conditions are there as well as some pseudocode for how it'll function when i actually code it

    **PUSHED!**
